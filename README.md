# Todo Application

## Phase 1:

Perform some refactoring of the To Do application as built by another team. This application mixes application state and user settings at the top level and passes things around. It was a good proof of concept, but we need to make this production ready.

* Style the application using the Blueprint Component API{target:_blank}

* Properly modularize the application into separate components

* Implement the Context API to make some basic application settings available to components

  - How many To Do Items to show at once

  - Whether or not to show completed items

## Technical Requirements / Notes

*Create a settings Context that can define how our components should display elements to the User.*

1. Implement the React context API for defining settings across the entire application.

  * Create a context for managing application display settings and provide this at the application level.

  * Display or Hide completed items (boolean).

  * Number of items to display per screen (number).

  * Default sort field (string).

  * Manually set (hard code) those state settings in the context provider’s state, they should not be changeable.

2. Consume and utilize context values throughout your components

  * Show a maximum of a certain number of items per screen in the <List /> component

    * Provide “next” and “previous” links to let the users navigate a long list of items

  * Hide or show completed items in the list

  * *Optional: Sort the items based on any of the keys (i.e. difficulty)*

**Pagination Notes:**

  * Only display the first n items in the list, where n is the number to display per screen in your context.

    * If you have more than n items in the list, add a button labeled Next that will replace the list with the next n items in the list.

    * If you are past the first n items (i.e. on page 2 or higher), add a button labeled Previous that will replace the list with the previous n items in the list.

## Testing

- Tests should assert all behavioral functionality

- Do a deep mount of the app, and set tests to make assertions on the child components that consume context from the Provider.

  - Can they see context?

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
